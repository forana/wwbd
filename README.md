# What Would Bob Do?
(a simple command-line game)

## Background
You are a mild-mannered office professional, returning from a business conference.

Your coworker, Bob, came along with you. You don't like Bob. Bob doesn't like you. It has not been a good trip, and you'd like to get home and away from Bob.

On the flight back, your plane, flight 183, crashed abruptly somewhere in the middle of nowhere in the midwestern United States.

You survived, of course, and so did Bob. Only three others survived - their names Gabriel, Patricia, and Kevin - office professionals like yourself.

Nearly immediately after landing and determining that you five were the only survivors, the five of you realized that the plane's wreckage was fully on fire - including any food, or any of your luggage. None of you know exactly where you are, and none of you managed to grab your phones before crawling out.

Thankfully, none of you were seriously injured. But you're office drones - you don't know a thing about survival.

The party held a vote - you're the leader, tasked with getting everyone home.

Bob didn't vote for you. Bob thinks he can do better.

Good luck.
